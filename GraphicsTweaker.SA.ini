[Quality]
FixBrightnessSettingForDynamic = 1   # Fixes ambient lighting for dynamic objects (peds, vehicles etc) not following the menu brightness setting.
SmartAnisotropicFiltering      = 1   # The level of anisotropic filtering is defined by your game quality settings. (MixSets replaces, if you want to use this, keep "ForceAnisotropic = 0" in MixSets).

# The settings below are the same as MixSets; and MixSets replaces.
ForceAnisotropicFiltering      = 0   # Always use anisotropic filtering, even without "Very High". It will use the maximum level (16).
ForceAnisotropicFilteringLevel = -1  # Force a specific level of AF (2, 4, 8 or 16), replacing the above function. Use "-1" to not change and use the default (16).

DisableGamma = 1  # Disables the game's gamma change. The gamma result is not so good and does not appear when taking a screen print.


[Timecycle]
EnableTimecycleTweaks        = 0  # Enable timecycle changes. Use "0" to disable everything below.
ForceColorFilterOnlyIfNotSet = 1  # Only force the color filter to change if it is 0 (for example, Real Linear Graphics).

# Force the color filter to change. If "ForceColorFilterOnlyIfNotSet = 1", it will only change if the original value is 0.
# Use up to "255.0". Using "0.0" values causes the screen to go black in some color filters, such as the SkyGfx's PS2 and Mobile.
# Values are RGBA, with "A" meaning intensity.
#ForceColorFilterR = 128.0
#ForceColorFilterG = 128.0
#ForceColorFilterB = 128.0
#ForceColorFilterA = 64.0

# Multiply the final color filter values.
# For example, if you use "2.0" for R and G, the game's color filter will be yellow.
MultColorFilterR = 1.0
MultColorFilterG = 1.0
MultColorFilterB = 1.0
MultColorFilterA = 1.0

MultStaticAmbientLighting  = 1.3  # Multiply ambient lighting for static objects (houses, buildings etc). Remembering that "ps2Modulate = 1" in SkyGfx also increases it.
MultDynamicAmbientLighting = 1.0  # Multiply the ambient lighting for dynamic objects (peds, vehicles, objects etc).

ForceFarClip  = -1   # Force the viewing distance. Values are around 100.0 and 1000.0. This can increase or decrease the game's FPS.
ForceFogStart = -1   # Force the fog start distance. Values are around 10.0 and 900.0.

MultFarClip  = 1.0   # Multiply the viewing distance. This can increase or decrease the game's FPS. Too high distance may need other adjustments to not cause bugs.
MultFogStart = 1.0   # Multiply the fog start distance.
